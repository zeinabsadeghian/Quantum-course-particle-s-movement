# Quantum-course-particle-s-movement
This reposetory is my universitie's quantum course project. The goal of this project is to simulate the movement of a particle's wave function in different voltage function.
An interesting paper to read on this subject:

Also I used this paper to solve shcrodinger's equation:

Same approach is taken in scipy library
